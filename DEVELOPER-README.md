## DEV_MODE — Modifying the System

`$APP_DIR` is read-only by default. A `PreToolUse` hook (`scripts/check-dev-mode.sh`) intercepts every `Write` and `Edit` call to files inside `$APP_DIR` and blocks them when `DEV_MODE=false`. The same hook also blocks direct writes to `$APPLICANT_DIR` when `DATA_BACKEND=ob1`, enforcing MCP-only access to applicant data.

**To enable APP_DIR editing:**
1. Open `.env` and set `DEV_MODE="true"` — no restart needed
2. Proceed with edits (if Claude is paused waiting, reply "continue")
3. When done, set `DEV_MODE="false"`

`DEV_MODE` is read on every tool call, so toggling it mid-session takes effect immediately.

If the hook blocks a write mid-session, Claude pauses and reports: which file was blocked, that DEV_MODE is off, and how to resume. Reply "continue" after enabling DEV_MODE and it retries.

---

## Two-Repo Architecture

| Directory | Purpose | Git-tracked | Writable by default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$APP_DIR` (this repo) | Process, tooling, templates, memory | Yes | No (DEV_MODE gate) |
| `$APPLICANT_DIR` | Applicant data, applications, profiles, tracker | No | Yes |

Paths are defined in `.env` (gitignored). `$APPLICANT_DIR` is set during `bash scripts/setup.sh` to a local directory or a cloud sync service's managed folder (Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox, or Box). The OS syncs automatically when a cloud service is chosen.

## OB1 Kubernetes Deployment

For a user-facing comparison of all deployment modes and end-to-end setup instructions (local, Docker Compose, K8s, OB1 default), see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

OB1 is an optional replacement for the local `$APPLICANT_DIR` + cloud sync path. Instead of flat files synced via Google Drive/OneDrive/etc., all applicant content lives in a local Kubernetes cluster:

- **MinIO** — object store for all files (notes, JDs, PDFs, profiles)
- **PostgreSQL** (`js_*` tables) — structured state (pipeline, contacts, interviews, search runs)
- **pgvector** — semantic search over all content via OB1's `thoughts` table

**Prerequisite:** A local clone of the OB1 repo is required (`$OB1_REPO_PATH` in `.env`) to build the `openbrain-mcp-server:latest` Docker image used by the OB1 StatefulSet. The `job-search-mcp` image is built from this repo and has no external dependency.

### Architecture (3 pods + nginx Ingress)

| Component | What it is | URL |
|---|---|---|
| `openbrain-0` | StatefulSet: PostgreSQL + OB1 MCP sidecar | `http://localhost/ob1/mcp` |
| `job-search-mcp` | Deployment: Deno/Hono server — 17 MCP tools + REST API (`/api/v2/*`) | `http://localhost/job-search/mcp` · `http://localhost/job-search/api/v2/*` |
| `minio` | Deployment: S3-compatible object store | `http://localhost/minio` (console) / `localhost:30900` (S3) |
| nginx Ingress | Routes `/ob1`, `/job-search`, `/minio` | Port 80 — no per-session port-forwarding |

All services are permanently accessible through nginx Ingress once deployed. PostgreSQL is cluster-internal; use `kubectl port-forward svc/openbrain-db -n openbrain 5432:5432` on demand (required for `migrate-to-ob1.py` only — the webapp no longer accesses Postgres directly).

**Single write path:** In OB1 mode, both Claude Code (via MCP tools) and the webapp (via REST) write through the same `*Core()` functions in `job-search-tools.ts`. This ensures every file write triggers the same 4-step embedding transaction (S3 write → thought embedding → metadata extraction → Postgres upsert) regardless of which client initiates it. The webapp drops all direct Postgres and MinIO credentials — it needs only `JOB_SEARCH_REST_URL` and `JOB_SEARCH_MCP_KEY`.

### MCP transport

Both servers use the **Streamable HTTP** transport. Claude Code requires:
- `"type": "http"` in `.mcp.json`
- URL pointing to the `/mcp` endpoint (e.g. `http://localhost/ob1/mcp`)
- `x-brain-key` auth header

`.mcp.json` is gitignored and auto-generated by `bash scripts/k8s-apply-env.sh` from `.env` values.

### Session-start protocol

When `DATA_BACKEND=ob1` in `.env`, Claude Code verifies that `mcp__job-search__*` and `mcp__open-brain__*` appear in the deferred tools list at session start. If they do not appear — hard stop, do not fall back to local files or cloud sync. Tell the user to restart Claude Code. See `policies/storage-routing/` (pinned version).

### Data persistence (Docker Desktop)

Postgres data and MinIO objects are stored in hostPath volumes at `/var/openbrain/db` and `/var/openbrain/minio` inside the Docker Desktop VM. These survive pod restarts but are wiped on full cluster teardown. Clean teardown requires a privileged pod to delete contents before the namespace is deleted.

### Key scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/start-ob1.sh` | Start OB1 docker-compose services (sources both `.env` and `.env.services`) |
| `scripts/k8s-apply-env.sh` | Creates all k8s Secrets/ConfigMaps from `.env` + `.env.services`; generates `.mcp.json` |
| `scripts/migrate-to-ob1.py` | One-time migration of local APPLICANT_DIR to MinIO + Postgres |
| `integrations/ob1/tests/test-deployment.sh` | 19-assertion deployment verification suite |

**Full deployment guide:** [integrations/ob1/README.md](integrations/ob1/README.md)

---

## Webapp

For deployment options (local launch, Docker Compose, K8s) and a comparison of all modes, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

The browser webapp (`webapp/`) provides a React + FastAPI UI for browsing and editing applicant data. It supports both `local` and `ob1` data modes (selected by `DATA_BACKEND` in `.env`).

See [webapp/README.md](webapp/README.md) for prerequisites, configuration, launch instructions, API endpoints, and test suites.

### Containerization

Two Docker images are built from the repo root:

| Image | Dockerfile | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `job-search-webapp:latest` | `webapp/Dockerfile` | FastAPI backend + compiled React frontend |
| `job-search-claude-runner:latest` | `webapp/runner/Dockerfile` | Claude subprocess sidecar |

**Multi-stage build** (`webapp/Dockerfile`): Stage 1 (`node:20-slim`) builds the React frontend and installs the `claude` binary via npm. Stage 2 (`python:3.11-slim`) copies the binary and runs uvicorn. Both stages use Debian so the binary is glibc-compatible.

**Claude runner** (`webapp/runner/`): A thin FastAPI sidecar that wraps `claude` subprocess calls. The webapp routes to it when `CLAUDE_RUNNER_URL` is set (always set in K8s via `webapp-configmap`; unset in docker-compose, where the webapp uses its built-in binary). The runner exposes `POST /run` — accepts `{args, cwd, message}`, streams NDJSON back verbatim. This separates the subprocess boundary without changing the wire protocol. The runner binary lives at `/runner/runner.py` (not `/app`) so an emptyDir mount at `/app` can't overlay it.

### K8s webapp deployment

Deploys alongside the existing OB1 services in the `openbrain` namespace. The pod runs an init container + two app containers:

- **init-app-dir**: copies `/app` from the webapp image into a shared `app-dir` emptyDir so both the webapp and the runner see identical project files (CLAUDE.md, memory/, scripts/, etc.)
- **webapp**: mounts `app-dir` at `/app`; entrypoint writes `/app/.env` and `/app/.mcp.json` from env vars, then starts uvicorn
- **claude-runner**: mounts `app-dir` at `/app` so the `claude` subprocess finds CLAUDE.md and .mcp.json; runner binary lives at `/runner/` to avoid mount overlay

```bash
docker build -f webapp/Dockerfile -t job-search-webapp:latest .
docker build -f webapp/runner/Dockerfile webapp/runner/ -t job-search-claude-runner:latest
bash scripts/k8s-apply-env.sh          # creates webapp-secret
kubectl apply -f integrations/ob1/k8s/webapp-configmap.yml
kubectl apply -f integrations/ob1/k8s/webapp.yml
kubectl apply -f integrations/ob1/k8s/webapp-nodeport.yml
```

Access at `http://localhost:30800`. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_DEPLOYMENT_KEY` in `.env` (no OAuth in containers) for chat sessions.

### Environment file split

Two files, both gitignored, serve different audiences:

| File | Contents | Who sources it |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `.env` | Claude CLI config: paths, MCP keys, search API, `DEV_MODE` | Claude Code shell session |
| `.env.services` | Storage credentials: MinIO, Postgres, LLM API keys, `ANTHROPIC_API_DEPLOYMENT_KEY` | `scripts/start-ob1.sh`, `scripts/k8s-apply-env.sh` |

**Why the split:** Claude's shell inherits every exported var. Keeping storage credentials out of `.env` means Claude (and any Bash tool calls it makes) cannot reach MinIO, Postgres, or LLM APIs directly — all applicant data must flow through the OB1 MCP tools. See [policies/storage-routing/](policies/storage-routing/) (pinned version).

Copy both example files to get started:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.services.example .env.services
# Fill in both files with your values
```

### docker-compose

Two compose files, combine with `-f` flags:

| File | Contents |
|------|---------|
| `webapp/docker-compose.yml` | Webapp service only (needs `.env` only — no storage credentials required) |
| `integrations/ob1/docker-compose.yml` | PostgreSQL + MinIO + openbrain MCP + job-search-mcp |

```bash
# Webapp only (local mode)
docker compose -f webapp/docker-compose.yml up

# OB1 infrastructure only (postgres + minio + mcp servers)
bash scripts/start-ob1.sh up -d

# Full OB1 stack (webapp + all 4 OB1 services)
docker compose -f webapp/docker-compose.yml up &
bash scripts/start-ob1.sh up -d
```

`scripts/start-ob1.sh` sources both `.env` and `.env.services` before invoking `docker compose` so the `${VARNAME}` interpolations in `integrations/ob1/docker-compose.yml` resolve correctly. Run it with any `docker compose` subcommand (`up`, `down`, `logs`, `ps`, etc.).

For OB1 compose mode, set these in `.env.services` before running (values differ from K8s defaults):
```
DB_HOST=postgres
MINIO_ENDPOINT=minio:9000
```
And in `.env`:
```
DATA_BACKEND=ob1
OB1_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8080
JOB_SEARCH_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8081
JOB_SEARCH_REST_URL=http://job-search-mcp:8001
```
Then re-run `bash scripts/k8s-apply-env.sh` to regenerate `.mcp.json` with the compose-mode URLs.

---

## Slash Command Architecture

Commands are defined as Markdown files in `$APP_DIR/.claude/commands/`. Claude Code auto-loads them — the filename (without `.md`) becomes the slash command name.

| File | Command |
|------|---------|
| `commands/setup.md` | `/setup` |
| `commands/context.md` | `/context` |
| `commands/status.md` | `/status` |
| `commands/audit.md` | `/audit` |
| `commands/apply.md` | `/apply` |
| `commands/interview.md` | `/interview` |
| `commands/memory.md` | `/memory` |
| `commands/ingest.md` | `/ingest` |
| `commands/linkedin-ingest.md` | `/linkedin-ingest` |

**To add a command:** Create a new `.md` file in `.claude/commands/`. The file's content is the instruction Claude receives when the command is invoked. Takes effect at the next session — no restart needed.

**To modify a command:** Edit the `.md` file directly (requires `DEV_MODE=true`). Same timing.

Commands are git-tracked and contain no PII — available on any machine that clones this repo.

---

## Hook System

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` under the `hooks` key.

### PreToolUse — DEV_MODE gate

Runs `scripts/check-dev-mode.sh` before every `Write` or `Edit` tool call. Two rules enforced:
- If target path is inside `$APP_DIR` and `DEV_MODE=false` → blocked (set `DEV_MODE=true` to enable)
- If target path is inside `$APPLICANT_DIR` and `DATA_BACKEND=ob1` → blocked (use `upload_file()` MCP tool instead)

The script reads `DEV_MODE` from `.env` on every invocation — toggling the value mid-session takes effect immediately.

### Stop — memory sync

Runs `scripts/sync-memory.sh` after every Claude response. The script:
1. Checks for uncommitted changes in `$APP_DIR/memory/`
2. If any exist, commits them with an auto-generated message
3. Copies all `memory/*.md` files to `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` so the live session picks them up on the next message

### PostToolUse — write summary

Runs `scripts/summarize-write.sh` after every `Write` tool call. Outputs a one-line impact summary for significant file writes (e.g., resume written, notes updated). Suppresses output for routine or system files.

To add or modify hooks, edit the `hooks` section in `.claude/settings.json` (requires `DEV_MODE=true`).

---

## Memory System

Two memory locations serve different purposes:

| Location | Scope | Sync |
|---|---|---|
| `$APP_DIR/memory/` | Process rules, feedback, references | Auto via Stop hook; git-tracked |
| `$APPLICANT_DIR/memory/` | Applicant-specific context | Updated in real-time; local only |

`MEMORY.md` is the index — loaded at session start and used to decide which files to consult. `feedback_*.md` files hold the detailed rules.

### File format

```markdown
---
name: Short name
description: One-line description used to assess relevance in future sessions
type: feedback | project | user | reference
---

[body — for feedback/project types: lead with the rule, then **Why:** and **How to apply:** lines]
```

### Manual sync

```bash
bash "$APP_DIR/scripts/sync-memory.sh"
```

Use this after editing memory files outside a Claude session (e.g., directly in a text editor).

---

## Customizing Workflow Rules

Process rules live in four locations with different scopes:

| Location | Scope | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/`, `policies/`, `workflows/` | Versioned procedures; resolved per mode (interactive: draft-first; webapp: pinned-only) | **Preferred for procedural rules** — JD screening, resume generation, interview prep, storage routing, domain connection. Change via `/skill draft` → `/skill promote` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Always-loaded; applies every session | Critical rules and workflow triggers that must be visible at session start |
| `memory/feedback_*.md` | Loaded on demand; indexed via `MEMORY.md` | Session/tooling mechanics (DEV_MODE, commits, model selection, doc maintenance). Migrated procedural entries are pointer stubs — do not add rules to them |
| `$APPLICANT_DIR/memory/` | Applicant-specific; local only | Role preferences, deal-breakers, search state |

**To add or update a procedural rule:** run `/skill draft <name>`, edit `draft.md`, exercise it on real work, then `/skill promote <name> [--pin]` (test-gated; `--pin` moves the version the webapp executes). Requires `DEV_MODE=true`.

**To add or update a session/tooling rule:**
1. Edit the relevant `memory/feedback_*.md` file (or `CLAUDE.md` for session-critical rules). Requires `DEV_MODE=true`.
2. If you edited `CLAUDE.md` or a `memory/` file, run the sync script so the live session picks up the change:
   ```bash
   bash "$APP_DIR/scripts/sync-memory.sh"
   ```
   The Stop hook runs this automatically after every Claude response — manual sync is only needed when editing outside a session.

**`MEMORY.md`** is the index for all `memory/` files. Add a one-line pointer entry whenever you create a new `feedback_*.md` file.

---

## JD Fetching

`scripts/fetch-jd.py` uses Playwright to fetch job description pages. Called automatically by Claude during the JD workflow.

**Primary path:** Claude tries WebFetch first. On login wall or failure, falls back to the Playwright script.

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — success
- `1` — navigation error → ask user to paste JD text
- `2` — auth required or expired → show user the `--setup` command from stderr
- `3` — job posting closed or no longer available → skip; folder not created

**Auth setup for login-walled sites:**

```bash
source "$APP_DIR/.env"
"$PLAYWRIGHT_PYTHON" "$APP_DIR/scripts/fetch-jd.py" --setup 'https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/123'
```

Opens the default browser → log in → press Enter. The script scans Firefox profiles for session cookies. Falls back to manual DevTools entry (`F12 → Application → Cookies`, copy the session cookie name and value).

Auth is saved to `$APPLICANT_DIR/.auth/<domain>.json`. Re-run `--setup` or `--import` when exit code 2 is returned.

> **Note:** Chromium-family browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc) encrypt cookies via the OS keychain, which requires system-level access and is not reliably available to external tools. Use Firefox or the manual DevTools fallback.

**Import cookies from Firefox without opening a browser:**

```bash
"$PLAYWRIGHT_PYTHON" "$APP_DIR/scripts/fetch-jd.py" --import linkedin.com
```

**Save full page text as markdown to a file:**

```bash
"$PLAYWRIGHT_PYTHON" "$APP_DIR/scripts/fetch-jd.py" --md-out "$FOLDER/jd-company-role.md" "<url>"
```

---

## PDF Generation

Resumes are authored in Markdown and converted to PDF via pandoc → Playwright (headless Chromium). Never use `--print-to-pdf` via Chrome directly — Chrome adds filename/filepath to headers/footers.

```bash
source "$APP_DIR/.env"

# Standard 2-page resume
pandoc "$RESUME_MD" -o "$RESUME_HTML" --css="$APP_DIR/templates/resume.css" --standalone
"$PLAYWRIGHT_PYTHON" "$APP_DIR/scripts/generate-pdf.py" "$RESUME_HTML" "$RESUME_PDF"
rm "$RESUME_HTML"
pdfinfo "$RESUME_PDF" | grep Pages

# 1-page variant
pandoc "$RESUME_MD" -o "$RESUME_HTML" \
  --css="$APP_DIR/templates/resume.css" \
  --css="$APP_DIR/templates/one-page-override.css" \
  --standalone
"$PLAYWRIGHT_PYTHON" "$APP_DIR/scripts/generate-pdf.py" "$RESUME_HTML" "$RESUME_PDF"
rm "$RESUME_HTML"
pdfinfo "$RESUME_PDF" | grep Pages
```

`$PLAYWRIGHT_PYTHON` is set by `scripts/setup.sh` and stored in `.env`. Always source `.env` before generating — never probe for the Python path at generation time.

---

## Profile System

Each profile represents a target role type. Two files per profile:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `[profile-name].md` | Strategy document — how to position for this role type |
| `[profile-name]-CONTENT.md` | Pre-compiled resume content library — source for all bullet generation |

Supporting files:
- `EXPERIENCE-REFERENCE.md` — canonical verified role history, education, certifications. All resume generation draws from this only.
- `PROFILES-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` — fast matching guide used by the Haiku screening agent
- `role-achievements.md` — achievement set scored against active profiles
- `base-documents/` — setup input only; not read during the normal workflow

See `templates/PROFILES-README.md` for authoring guidance.

## Markdown Hygiene Rules

Every `.md` file committed to `$APP_DIR` must:
- Use "the applicant" or "the user" — never the applicant's name
- Not contain hard-coded absolute paths

Enforced by `scripts/check-md-hygiene.sh` (pre-commit hook). The hook reads `APPLICANT_NAME` from `.env` for the name check. Install once with `bash scripts/install-hooks.sh`.
